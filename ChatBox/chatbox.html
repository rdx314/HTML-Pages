         <p class="chat-message">Galileo Galilei was born in the city of Pisa, in the northern Italian region of Tuscany, on February 15, 1564. His father was Vincenzo Galilei, an accomplished musician who worked as a wool trader. Galileo’s mother came from a higher social station than her husband, and she has been described as a shrewish, demanding woman, ever resentful of Vincenzo’s failure to rise above his lower-class origins. Galileo being a great Italian astronomer, mathematician, and physicist laid foundations for modern experimental science, and by the construction of astronomical telescope.</p>

         <p class="chat-message">The only thing required here is to be smart and practical, while deciding how often to binge on a favourite snack. Since fruits are healthy, one cannot just eat only fruits and eliminate everything else from his daily diet!! That would again leave him severely malnutritioned. Moreover, if one exercises regularly, then it doesn’t matter what one is eating as part of one’s diet.P.Finally, I feel the need to mention that many children in some parts of the world are dying of starvation everyday, and they don’t have this great choice to make. Any food, whether junk or otherwise, would be life for them. This debate would actually make them scoff at us!!</p>
